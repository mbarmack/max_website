    'A recent New York Times Report reveals that Iran may have enough nuclear material to build a bomb in less than a month. This frightening possibility redoubles the pressure on the Biden administration to enter a deal that would curb Iran’s nuclear capabilities. However, after the Trump administration decided to pull out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), U.S. credibility was damaged and the path to a future deal became more complicated.',

    'The JCPOA, which was agreed to in 2015, placed restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief from the U.S., EU, and UN. The problem with this deal, according to a Trump White House press release was that, “The JCPOA enriched the Iranian regime and enabled its malign behavior, while at best delaying its ability to pursue nuclear weapons and allowing it to preserve nuclear research and development.”  This is somewhat of a mischaracterization, given that the JCPOA raised Iran’s breakout time, or the time it would take to build a nuclear weapon, significantly.',

    'Regardless of whether you agree with the Trump administration’s logic, the reality is that the U.S. pulled out of the JCPOA while Iran was compliant. Alexandra Bell, the Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of Arms Control, Verification and Compliance (AVC), explains that, “compliance makes or breaks an agreement.” Iran trusted that the U.S. would not reimpose sanctions while they were compliant, and that trust was broken.',

    'Now, Iran is hesitant to re-enter an agreement because they fear that a future U.S. president would not uphold promises that Biden makes. This is a significant problem since U.S. leadership is liable to change every 4 years. Additionally, political polarization has made wide swings in the political beliefs of presidents more common. Given that a nuclear deal with Iran has become a highly politicized issue, this spells trouble. In spite of all of this, a deal is not impossible.',

    'Where do we go from here? Ms. Bell emphasized that the U.S. needs to acknowledge these past failings and convince Iran that they are still better off coming to the table. This shouldn’t be too hard to do. Since U.S. sanctions were reinstated, Irans economy has fallen into a deep recession. Oil exports have dropped, the value of Iran’s currency has halved, and the cost of living has gone up substantially. This is a dangerous set of circumstances for Iran. If they don’t find a way to alleviate the pressure imposed by U.S. sanctions, civil unrest is likely to follow. U.S. negotiators can appeal to the rationality of Iranian leaders and offer them a path towards economic prosperity if they agree to walk back their recent nuclear achievements. Let’s hope that Biden and the Iranians don’t dwell on the past and are able to reach an agreement that would improve the lives of Iranians and protect the world from more nuclear weapons.',

    'Mandatory military service has gotten a bad rap over the past century. The Vietnam war turned a large portion of young Americans firmly against compulsory service. This aversion was understandable considering the half-baked case for American involvement in Vietnam. Yet, opposition to mandatory service has proved durable. To this day, the U.S. military has been staffed by volunteers.',

And while this national disunity may not lead to blows, its consequences are no less frightening.

    'Sadly, America’s problems are not restricted to the home front. A lack of understanding about foreign policy has had catastrophic consequences. Over the past two decades, defense spending has run rampant as the United States prosecuted major wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and carried out counter-terrorism operations in scores of other countries. Air Force General John Hynten is among a growing group of defense experts who take issue with this reckless spending. “Do you think any taxpayer in this country would believe that for $700 billion a year, we can’t have a great defense?”  Hynten told Brookings. Maybe America’s lack of a cost-efficient defense is the result of legislative and executive branches staffed by people with a lack of understanding about what a military does and what spending should go towards.',

    'Additionally, American leaders unnecessarily endanger the lives of American service members too frequently. Former President Donald Trump implemented a “maximum pressure campaign” against Iran, significantly escalating tensions. This sort of reckless decision making could lead to skirmishes involving American service members or worse. Trump notably dodged service in the Vietnam war by claiming that he had bone spurs. It is unsettling to think that the country’s most important foreign policy decisions are made by people with no respect for or understanding of the military.',

    'Compulsory service is a fitting solution to both problems. It would bring young Americans from diverse geographic and political backgrounds together, and form bonds in the crucible of service. It would allow a liberal from New York or California to come face to face with the kind of conservative ideology only found in the bible belt. Additionally, it would give all Americans an intimate appreciation for the work that the military does and depth of knowledge about the consequences of violent action. In short: mandatory service would help the United States avoid fights and fiascos at home and abroad.',

It was a night game, and as the halftime whistle blew, the lights of the stadium shut down and the Michigan marching band took the field and commemorated the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. While the performance was stirring, the messaging felt hollow and reeked of misplaced patriotic fervor.',

As a child, I regularly drove past a hillside that had an ever-increasing number of white crosses commemorating American service members killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. I remember eating ice cream to celebrate Osama Bin Laden’s death. I read widely about the war and learned of the thousands of civilians killed in drone strikes, and the torture that occurred at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp. These are the costs of unmitigated patriotism and a trauma driven desire for an enemy.',

    'External competition has long driven both foreign and domestic policy in the United States. Competition with the Soviet Union fueled unprecedented investments in education and science. However, it also fueled a massive build up in global nuclear arms, and a war in Vietnam that cost the lives of nearly 60,000 Americans and hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese civilians. Conflicts in the Middle East following 9/11, spurred a period of national unity, but cost taxpayers trillions of dollars and resulted in the deaths of thousands of U.S. service members and Afghan civilians.
